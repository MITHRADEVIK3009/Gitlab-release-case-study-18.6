Feedback issue for new UI Closed Issue created 1 month ago by Michelle Gill What we need feedback on GitLab is introducing two major changes that we need your input on:

New panel-based interface - Panel-based layout
Persistent GitLab Duo panel - GitLab Duo is always available in far right panel for users with access

Focus Areas:

Overall feel and workflow impact (not just individual interactions)
What works well vs. what feels broken or frustrating
Visual issues, layout problems, missing functionality
How well the GitLab Duo panel enables your workflow

A note to the wider community Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us. I have personally read every message in this issue, and I genuinely appreciate the time you've taken to provide detailed feedback about the navigation changes. I want to acknowledge that this transition has been challenging for some of you, and your concerns are valid. While the data showed a low opt-out rate (<1%), I recognize that metrics don't capture the full picture of how changes impact individual workflows and preferences. For those who preferred the previous UI, I understand if this wasn't the outcome you hoped for. The new UI is now the standard experience moving forward. This decision wasn't made lightly, and maintaining two parallel UI structures long-term would significantly impact our ability to iterate and improve GitLab for everyone. That said, we're committed to addressing the remaining bugs and continuing to refine the experience based on your feedback. Many of the ideas shared here are valuable, and we're actively reviewing them for future iterations. Your input directly shapes how we prioritize improvements, so please continue sharing specific pain points or suggestions.

  * MEDIUM - I would really prefer if we still had the issue count, MR count and To Do list in the left side nav bar where it used to be. When I am not using the Duo Agent platform I find myself thinking about how do I get to my Issues now and it being in the top right corner doesn't seem intuitive to me compared to the old location in the left menu bar.

  What's Working Well
  * Duo being more integrated works well and makes me feel more inclined to use it over third-party AI LLMs

  * LOW / HIGH Feels like the break point for the issues drawer is not optimised. Previously, it would have the details and description sections next to each other horizontally by default on my display - now it's moved to vertically stacked - arguably too much space and I'm unable to resize it to be smaller.

    * Unsure
  What's Working Well
  * In general the new UI looks nice
  What Needs Fixing
  * LOW Having the MRs and To-Dos moved to the top right breaks my current workflow, which might just need some time to adapt, but at first it was really confusing where it went.
  * MEDIUM The new design adds a lot of extra spacings, e.g. the Duo Chat was added as not removable vertical bar at the right, which takes up additional space and reduces the available space for e.h. code reviewing where space is really needed.

Ciobanasu Ion@c-ionciob1 month ago   Hello everyone,   I’m using GitLab to manage issues and add test cases (TCs). Overall, the experience is quite good, but I’d like to suggest a feature that I believe would be very useful — ideally as an optional capability.   Currently, our test cases are stored in a separate project:   /quality/test_cases   Unfortunately, we are unable to link these test cases directly to issues in Linked Items.   I’ve tried to find a way to contact support, but the amount of information available makes it time-consuming to figure out the right channel. That’s why I’m submitting this request here.   Feature request: Please consider adding functionality that allows users to link test cases to issues. This would greatly improve traceability and workflow efficiency.   NOTE: I apologize if I'm in the wrong place—it's possible I'm not familiar with some procedures. If that's the case, could you kindly direct me to the appropriate channel or let me know where I can report a ticket?   Thank you very much!   Edited 1 month ago by Ciobanasu Ion

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes
    * No
    * Unsure
  What Needs Fixing
  * MEDIUM: With an ultra-wide display, having the main interactable elements of the home-screen UI divided between the left and right side of the display is fairly annoying. It means a lot of head turning depending on what I'm trying to do, where it was convenient with the old UI to have all the important stuff aligned to the left. Not the worst thing ever, but would be nice to keep the "always available" part of the UI collocated in one area of the window.
  -  
  - Dasha Adushkina@dashaadu1 month ago     Developer     @foxrobotics-mbasescu This is great feedback, thank you! With the split UI, are there particular buttons or sections that feel most distracting to how you worked before?
  - Max Basescu@foxrobotics-mbasescu1 month ago     No problem - it's the following buttons that now show up on the right side which I miss being on the left 😁
    * Profile icon
    * To-do items
    * Merge requests
    * Assigned issues
    * Create new...
    For reference, here's how it looks on my display:
  - Armin Berres@aberres1 month ago     Agreed. Having the most-used stuff (navigation vs todos and MRs) on the right and the left side drives me crazy so far.
  - Finn Fentker@ffentker3 weeks ago     +1. Especially on Ultrawide it's highly unintuitive.
  - Austin Regnery@aregnery3 weeks ago     Developer     @ffentker for what it's worth, I'm also an ultrawide monitor user. I know it feels a little awkward at first, but I'm hoping it settles in and feels more normal to with time.
  - Kevin Ashton@ashtonkd3 weeks ago     I agree that the GitLab UI looks/feels wonky with only a single panel displayed on a wide monitor, but it kind of always has. The new panels layout feels like it has a lot more potential for ultrawide monitors. It just needs to be common layout pattern across the whole site instead of only for epics/issues/tasks in specific situations. It could be great for other areas where you frequently move between sub-elements of a parent element.     For example, the following areas could greatly benefit from optionally opening sub-element links in a details panel on the same page:
    * viewing job logs from a pipeline page
    * viewing registry details from the registries page
    * viewing a files from the repository page
    The new panels layout is a much better use of space on an ultrawide display:           vs. the old floating drawer layout:

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes
    * No
    * Unsure
  What's Working Well I like the separation between the core task and the surrounding utilities/navigation elements.   What Needs Fixing
  * Include priority: HIGH (blocks work) / MEDIUM (annoying) / LOW (polish)
  * HIGH No scrollbar shown in job logs. Scrolling only possible via mouse wheel (my poor Carpal Tunnel Syndrome...). I'm on Firefox and use the light theme, if that matters.
  * MEDIUM A ton of screen real estate is wasted by having side/top bars all over the place when none of them is actually filled. Why is there a right hand side bar when the top bar is almost completely empty? Why is there a left side bar and a right side bar and a top side bar? I'm sorry to say it, but the compact design Github uses is just kilometers ahead of this redesign.
  * LOW Clicking my profile pic with the mouse wheel should open my profile page in a new tab
  GitLab Duo panel (Duo Agent Platform)
  * Do you use the GitLab Duo panel?
    * Frequently
    * Sometimes
    * Rarely
    * Never
  * If not using it, why?     Tried it once, it wasn't useful. I would strongly prefer GitLab prioritized core topics where issues have been open for years, sometimes more than a decade. For instance: A code owner needs to be able to filter the MR diff to only see changes he is responsible for. (#205201 5.5 years old)

Chad Lavimoniere@clavimoniere1 month ago   Developer   Just experienced the welcome modal for the first time, have some feedback:   Screen Recording 2025-10-28 at 12.59.24.mov

  * "Go Next" and "Go Back" don't really make sense. "Go Next" is not grammatical in English, and the capitalization is weird. Why aren't these just "Back" and "Next"?
  * The header of the modal should probably change with each slide. It's completely unclear unless you read the copy (which users won't) what each slide is trying to actually say

Bill Staples@bill_staples1 month ago   Developer   Not a super compelling experience, IMO. The only thing my eye sees is the H1, which doesn't change. The visuals are so subtle and abstract it is hard to map to the real experience, especially if this is popping up first time. Having a modal dialog with "Go Next" required clicking many times is annoying first time user experience.   Edited 1 month ago by Bill Staples

Mark Florian@markrian1 month ago   Maintainer   I've just experienced the welcome modal for the first time. Some thoughts:

  * It feels a little bit sluggish for me on Firefox. I'm guessing the the light beams/dusty backdrop is quite expensive. Here's a performance profile of it. Note the many paint operations in the renderer row which take >16ms, which means it's regularly falling below 60fps. This isn't a great experience, as it implies that the new experience as a whole will feel sluggish.
  * The "Go to GitLab" label on the final step is strangely worded. (See also #577554 (comment 2850969302) for "Go Next".) I would expect just an "Ok", or "Got it" or something to that effect instead.
  * The "Open feedback issue" link is worded that made me hesitate, as I didn't want to open a brand new feedback issue. It was only on inspecting the URL that I realised it would take me to an existing feedback issue (i.e., this one).

  *  
  * Thomas Hutterer@thutterer1 month ago     Maintainer     @aregnery @jmiocene Same as Mark, I saw the welcome modal for the first time and have some thoughts.     Some may be nitpicky, but since this modal tour is the very first interaction users will have with the redesign, every detail matters:
    * Why are there bubbles in the background? Seriously that was the first thing that came to mind 🫧 They distracted me from the content.
    * In the first screen where it transitions from old to new UI, a user who doesn't know/care too much will have a hard time telling what is the new and what is the old form. Some labels or ✨ might help. Or just play the animation once, stopping at the new form.
    * First screen button label "Get started": my thought was "get started with what? I have work to do" ... this should be labeled with "Next".
    * Bonus nitpick: This tour does also not tell me how many steps there are, so I don't know what I commit to as a user when clicking "Get started". It should show something like "1/4". Ah I just notice there are step indicator dots on the slides, sorry, I missed that earlier.
    * Also this button should sit on the right of the modal, like all the other "Next" buttons.
    * On another screen it says "all your work items conveniently positioned in the upper right"... What it means are the issues/mrs/todos links (Internally called UserCounts) but "work items" is a different concept in GitLab and we should not use it here to not mix up terminology.
    * On the last slide it says "this sleek panel UI".... I don't like it (as a user) when a website tells me how I should feel about its redesign. Is it really sleek? That's for the users to decide 😅
    Edited 1 month ago by Thomas Hutterer
  * Austin Regnery@aregnery1 month ago     Developer     Why are there bubbles in the background? Seriously that was the first thing that came to mind 🫧     The particle effects are visual flair.     "all your work items conveniently positioned in the upper right"... What it means are the issues/mrs/todos links (Internally called UserCounts) but "work items" is a different concept     Good point,I think "all your shortcuts are positioned in the upper right" would be more true to the features they are.     First screen button label "Get started": my thought was "get started with what?     Feels self explanatory to me, but we can revisit that wording.     "this sleek panel UI"....

  * Marcin Sedlak-Jakubowski@msedlakjakubowski1 month ago     Maintainer     @markrian @aregnery @annabeldunstone I also don't like apps telling me what to feel (that's why we avoid "easy" or "simple" in docs. My previous proposed copy used "modern" (even though I'm not sure what it means either).

유병문@whyrough1 month ago   Summary   In GitLab EE 18.5.1 (Free tier), when using the new UI, Mermaid charts in Wiki pages are printed too small in PDF exports.   When the new UI is disabled, the charts print normally at the correct size.   Steps to Reproduce

  1. Enable the New UI in GitLab.
  2. Open a Wiki page containing a Mermaid chart.
  3. Use “Export as PDF” to print or save the Wiki page.
  Actual Behavior
  * The Mermaid chart is rendered extremely small in the exported PDF.
  * Text and diagram elements are barely visible.
      Expected Behavior
  * The chart should render at a normal readable scale, consistent with how it appears in the Wiki preview.
      Environment
  * GitLab Edition: EE (Free tier)
  * GitLab Version: 18.5.1
  * Browser: Any (Chrome, Safari tested)
  * PDF Export: Built-in GitLab Wiki export feature
  Additional Notes
  * This issue does not occur when the New UI is disabled — the chart renders correctly in PDF exports.
  * Issue appears to be related to Mermaid rendering scaling in the new UI’s PDF export pipeline.
  -  
  - Sascha Eggenberger@seggenberger1 month ago     Developer     @himkp @afracazo is this known?
  - Himanshu Kapoor@himkp1 month ago     Maintainer     No, this isn't known. Created #578972.
  - John Hope@johnhope3 weeks ago     Developer     I think this is fixed with !212286 (merged). @whyrough could you check please?
  - 유병문@whyrough3 weeks ago     @johnhope     Issue Summary     When exporting wiki pages to PDF, Mermaid diagrams are rendered at an unexpectedly small size in GitLab EE (self-hosted) 18.5.2. This behavior does not occur on gitlab.com.     Details
    1. gitlab.com behavior
       * Mermaid diagrams maintain normal size when exporting to PDF.
       * This appears to be because the sidebar is included during PDF export, which stabilizes the layout.
       * However, the sidebar’s background color is still visible in the exported PDF.
        
    2. GitLab EE 18.5.2 (self-hosted) behavior
       * When exporting from the new UI, Mermaid diagrams appear significantly smaller.
       * This seems to be caused by the sidebar not being included in the exported layout, resulting in a different rendering context.
        
    Impact     Our customers still require printed documentation.     If PDF exports continue to display Mermaid diagrams incorrectly or include unintended sidebar background colors, it will negatively affect document quality and hinder our ability to deliver materials to clients.     Request     Please investigate the inconsistency between gitlab.com and GitLab EE 18.5.2 and address the rendering issues during PDF export:
    * Mermaid diagram scaling differences
    * Sidebar background color appearing in exported PDFs
    Fixing these issues is important for producing accurate, print-ready documentation.
  - John Hope@johnhope3 weeks ago     Developer     @whyrough Understood. Sorry about this. It's not happening on gitlab.com because we've fixed it already and the fix will be included in GitLab 18.6. The workaround in the mean time is to toggle the new experience off and use the old interface to print the PDF.

  - Emily Bauman@emilybauman1 month ago     Developer     @gautier.cuquemelle - Thanks for the feedback on the new UI. The labels, assignee, and milestone visibility issue you mentioned is important to understand better so we can iterate towards a better experience.     When you say you're "losing issue informations in 'preview' mode (right side)" - are you referring to when the interface switches to a double-panel layout? For example, when you have two main content areas on the left and the panel (like AI chat) open on the right side, does the issue sidebar information disappear or become less accessible?     It would help to confirm the specific scenario where you're losing visibility of those key details so we can address the right workflow issue.     Thanks again for the feedback!
  - Gautier Cuquemelle@gautier.cuquemelle1 month ago     Hello @emilybauman,     They you for your comment.     This is what I can see today when opening an issue. In the red rectangle are informations that are very important to see at first sight :     With the new view, these information are only displayed after issue description. We need to scroll down (sometimes a lot) to find it :
  - Emily Bauman@emilybauman1 month ago     Developer     @gautier.cuquemelle - Thank you for confirming! We'll definitely look into how to make this a better experience in future iterations.
  - n7800@n78003 weeks ago     Contributor     @gautier.cuquemelle, if I expand the left panel (arrow below), the issues opening in the right half will take up most of the space, and they will have a sidebar on the right with labels/milestones and such:     CollapsedExpanded     But I see that you already have it expanded... Either this has changed over the past week, or it's somehow dependent on your screen width. You can try changing the width of your browser window to confirm.
  - Gautier Cuquemelle@gautier.cuquemelle1 day ago     Hello @emilybauman,     This is is clearly a regression, now that we have no choice but to endure this change ! I can either lose visibility in sidebar buy collapsing it, set zoom to 90% in brother, or lose visibility on all important informations in the ticket : assignee, status, lables , Milestone, Weight, Parent.     Having a screen resolution of 1920 x 1200 should be enough to avoid having to choose between several essential elements.     Definitely a very bad experience

(Session ID 1209210). I logged out of my account and logged back into Okta and the agentic mode started working again. I wouldn't have guessed this was related to this with the prompt I was getting.

Andrew Bacon@abacon-gitlab1 month ago   Developer   In the new design, I was unable to find the the old design's equivalent of the + button, in order to add a new issue. Had to switch back to the old design to do it.   Eventually, I figured out that it's moved and changed to the very small square with a plus on the top right.   I imagine you're already aware of this awkwardness but spelling it out:

  1. Old Plus icon was changed. Why?
  2. There are now two different plus icons, one with old functionality, and one dedicated to chat functions. Why?
  3. We now have two different plus icons located in the top right corner of the screen, pretty close to each other.

     > Your role: Software engineer   >   > Main workflows: Issues   **Overall Assessment**   - Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?     - [ ] Yes     - [ ] No     - [x] Unsure   **What's Working Well**   * Looks cleaner and more modern   **What Needs Fixing**   * LOW The issues, MRs, and todo buttons with counts all moved from the top of the left-sidebar to the top-right of the page. The search is now top center and my main nav is still on the left sidebar. Something really nice about the previous UI was that I had one place to look for all my notifications and major nav actions: the left sidebar. Also, removing the background on those buttons make it harder to discern them at a glance; I have to look and focus for a moment on which I'm looking at with the counts. Think I preferred having all my "look at stuff" in a single space in the top-left sidebar.   * LOW The search bar at top just leads to an inch of lost real estate on the page, meaning I have to scroll down to see more. Since you're using a command-palette like search popup, you don't need the actual search bar to be "big" or wide, so it's needlessly taking up space. I suspect many are using keyboard shortcut "/" to search, which makes it even less important to be big. Would be curious if you are tracking the stats on that to know how many users are using the hotkeys.   * LOW Don't like the new "+" icon in the top-right. It's small, and honestly not a very conventional icon IMO. The standard "+" you had before was more conventional and easier to understand.   * LOW The new UI seems to involve an increased number of sticky headers as I scroll, which means more motion on the page, more "jankiness" as buttons slightly shift, etc...   **GitLab Duo panel (Duo Agent Platform)**   - Do you use the GitLab Duo panel?     - [ ] Frequently     - [ ] Sometimes     - [ ] Rarely     - [x] Never   - If not using it, why?

I now have rounded corners at the top and padding on the sides which take up space without providing any real benefit. Gitlab is an application site that benefits from density of content on the screen. It's not like a blog application where breathing room makes it easier to read or process info.

Dan LeGrand@dlegr2503 weeks ago   Not sure if you wanted this issue to be exclusively for the panel UI changes, but here's a minor cosmetic UI issue I came across using the new UI. When you have a long project name, it doesn't truncate the text on the left sidebar navigation. This may be intentional, but wanted to raise awareness if not; it looks a little clunky to have the project name wrap like that (see screenshot).   Applying some simple CSS to the tag solves it, not sure if you have a utility class that does this already:

     overflow: hidden;   text-overflow: ellipsis;   white-space: nowrap;   
  and then adding the full project name in the title attribute for cases where it's truncated.

mohsen shafiei@mohsenjch3 weeks ago   Hi, the scrollbar has become quite frustrating for me.

    * Yes

    * Unsure
  What's Working Well
  * The left sidebar with the links has not changed, and that is a good thing.
  What Needs Fixing
  * HIGH: Remove the modals to create new issues. It's useless, as they are too small to properly write content. Also after creating the issue, if you don't click on the link in the tiny notification, you basically loose the issue. It's very frustrating. It was so much better when it always opened a full new page. And clicking on the expand icon, every single time, just adds one more unnecessary step
  * MEDIUM: Please rename Parent to Epic in the right sidebar. It always takes me a while to remember that is what its for. And I had to ask around the first time you changed it, as I just couldn't find it.
  * LOW: One thing that could be improved as well, is the modal to move issues. When you open it, there is only one action you can do: click on the dropdown to open it. Why not opening it by default? that way, I have one less click to do, and after opening it, I can start typing straight away to filter the projects and find the one I want.

Thomas Näveke@Thomas.Naeveke3 weeks ago   Now that I have used the new UI for a while, I want to give some additional Feedback:

  * Split view for issue list + issues: There should be a toggle to enable/disable this. I can see how it is useful for some users, but it annoys me since I generally look at one issue at a time.
  * I really love the new overview for GitLab Runners in the CI/CD settings. Seeing at a glance which runners are busy/idle is a huge improvement.
  * There is a LOT of dead space in a lot of places - I'd appreciate a better use of my screen real estate here. Example: I'd propose collapsing the "Help" section at the bottom left into a single icon or a very slim icon bar that expands upon clicking. It uses way too much space that is permanently pinned whatever you do. I can't imagine many people use it. If they do, I think the icons should be enough.

Mikolaj Szabo@mikolajszabo3 weeks ago   Who needed or asked for a redesign? You're claiming in your bullshit popups that it is supposed to make people work faster, but what actually achieves this is people being able to rely on things working the same way today as yesterday, so that they don't have to re-learn a tool every single day. This is nothing more than a completely unnecessary distraction, which we can probably thank to useless people trying to make themselves look busy in a bloated organization.

  * Sascha Eggenberger@seggenberger3 weeks ago     Developer     @mikolajszabo could you share a bit more detail about what's not working well for you?

  * Miguel Rincon@mrincon3 weeks ago     Maintainer     @seggenberger We didn't explicitly change the breakpoint to stack the table, but now we stack earlier due to only considering the panel width when calculating (and not the viewport).     Stacking earlier (on smaller sizes) has some side effects as depending on the data, as some fields tend of overflow.

Jim Gorski@jim.gorski3 weeks ago   Every time you make a change to the UI - people have to update documentation to support internal customers. Unless the change is so positive that there is no longer a need for documentation you are making toil for teams rather than delighting your customers.   Also, making a visual change that only increases toil (and introduces risk from change) AND making it time gated so customers have to eventually leverage this completely non-essential change makes this toil now an urgent task since there's a time limit to when it becomes mandatory.   This topic will be raised at the next meeting between my company and Gitlab.

  What's Working Well
  * The new always-visible mini-sidebar on the left is really appreciated! The expanded left sidebar is a little too much a lot of the time, so it is nice to have a consistent way to get at those nav elements without having to hover over the "expand the nav temporarily" button and deal with the nav animating in and out.
  What Needs Fixing
  * MEDIUM - Scroll bars for the "{current context} panel" exist on the far right of the panel UI (just to the left of the GitLab Duo sidebar), making it harder to find:
    *  
    * This is especially confusing when on a page where the details sidebar also has its own scroll view, since the scroll bars appear out of order:
      *  
  * MEDIUM - Additionally, scroll bars now have no visible "channel", even when actively scrolling. This makes it harder to click to a certain part of the channel, either risking mis-clicks or having to solely grab the bar and move it that way.
    *  
  * MEDIUM - I don't love the lost real estate from the top search bar taking up vertical space and the GitLab Duo sidebar taking up horizontal space. Please at least make the latter minimizable (or move the Duo elements up to the top bar).

  What's Working Well
  * the design for this move to being less dense looks good... It is just less productive with having key buttons on both the far left and far right of the screen. Feels like putting form over function.
  What Needs Fixing
  * MEDIUM Having key buttons in the top right breaks years of muscle memory since the last redesign. Idc if everyone likes putting a user photo in the top right, I loved that gitlab had everything in a single panel that I could look/go to without thinking anytime I needed to navigate or get an update on my merge requests or tasks. Please move the buttons in the top-right back to the main panel - it was the best placement of all of my daily tools and I don't like having them split in the new design. Again, this feels like form over function - looks good and works worse.
  * MEDIUM Losing a whole row of vertical real estate for a search bar when it was perfectly find in the side bar feels like more form over function. Why does it need to look like every other app, when search is simply never as important as what is on the main panel.

  * Emily Bauman@emilybauman3 weeks ago     Developer     @m4lvin - Thanks for the feedback. Your point about the "welcome to the new design" message appearing too often is a good catch, that should definitely only show once.     The template pre-population suggestion is a great example of how the small things are important too, those practical workflow improvements really add up.

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes

    * Unsure
  What Needs Fixing
  * LOW: When in an issues board, the horizontal scrollbar isn't at the bottom of the screen anymore, instead it's lifted up a few pixels. I tend to have my windows full-screen, and am pretty used to throwing my mouse at the bottom of the screen then dragging around. Now it requires more a lot more precision to navigate the page.
  * LOW: I find that I don't like the The issues board split in half with the ticket description on the right. The theory would be that it's easier to explore tickets because the information can pop up, inline. In practice, the issues board because pretty annoying to navigate when confined to half a screen - I still prefer just opening tickets in new tabs (middle clicking). This means whenever I'm normal-clicking on a ticket, it's not because I want to preview it (I would have opened it in a new tab instead), instead I just want to replace the page with the ticket, probably because I'm going to start working on it. Now that takes two clicks instead of one - open the issue, then click the little link to make it take the full page.
  I understand why both of these changes were done, and I can see them being helpful for others. My gripes are also extremely minor. In the end, I know it's probably not something that's worth fixing, but just thought I would share my experience with it anyways.   Edited 3 weeks ago by Scotty Jamison
  *  
  * Emily Bauman@emilybauman3 weeks ago     Developer     @scotty.jamison Thanks for the feedback. The scrollbar positioning issue makes sense, losing that screen edge target would be frustrating in a workflow. Your point about the split view creating extra clicks when you just want to open the full issue is a good one too.     Appreciate you sharing your experience with these changes. Tagging @nickbrandt as I believe you have more context into these problem.

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes
    * No
    * Unsure
  What Needs Fixing
  * MEDIUM - side bar does not fully collapse as it does in the old UI, thus taking up space that could be better used (ie reduce line wrapping) and in combination with the un-needed trim on the right of the page this cuts the 'useful' horizontal space down from 1440 px to 1369px (on my monitor)
  * MEDIUM - lack of pop-out on mouse over for the left side bar (was a feature in the old UI) is a time sink, as I have to expand/collapse it manually to see the names of items/sections
  * LOW - the scrollbar for the log in the, pipeline page, should be next to the log itself not at the extreme right of the page
  * LOW - there is no need for curved edges everywhere, they result in needing more padding and that uses up more space
  * LOW - An option to collapse the top banner (much like can be done with the left side menu) would be good so it is possible to maximise the 'useful' space in the browser window

While it may look less dense because elements appear softer, this approach lets us reduce padding and make better use of space. We've already started applying it in several areas and will keep optimizing further.

    * Yes

  What's Working Well
  * Looks pretty
  * I like the side by side view for issues
  What Needs Fixing
  * Open threads navigator doesn't show once you scroll from the top of the MR if your screen width is 1280px (half of the with of a 1440p monitor) HIGH Fixed!
  * Total +/- lines count doesn't show at all if your screen width is 1280px MEDIUM
  * Cannot scroll in an MR if your mouse is on the far LHS of the screen as this is outside the component that is scrolling. So all that thin purple bar is doing is making be watch where my mouse is rather than just move it left out of my way and then scroll as I work MEDIUM
  I'll note two things here.
  * I spent the day dealing with a backlog of MRs and reviews on my MRs before I got the email telling me how to turn off the new UI, it was pretty painful.
  * I tend to have an open MR on one half of my screen (1440p) and other things (vscode, the app, another browser window on the other). This workflow is now broken. But I'd give it another go if it gets fixed.

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes
    * No
    * Unsure
  What's Working Well
  * It adopts the Apple Round Corner(tm) design nicely, I suppose.
  What Needs Fixing
  * HIGH - It breaks visual pathing that I am accustomed to. As an autistic individual, the new UI changes too much for me to actually be able to use effectively and productively. When I instinctively cannot find the "search or goto" field how can I possibly use the new UI?
  * HIGH - It feels way too busy without providing any additional value.
  * HIGH - The over abundance of saturated colors on labels is visually distracting, hard to parse, and makes it difficult to understand.
  * MEDIUM - Why is everything moved from the cozy, top-left corner, to... only Oshon, The Wanderer, knows where?

  * If not using it, why?
  Besides the environmental impact and the ethical implications of AI being trained on and just mashing together content collected without explicit consent? I am an artist who finds joy and purpose in writing code myself. Why would I relegate that to an AI I never asked for? I have zero faith in an AI to actually be able to write functional and cohesive code and even more so code that fits established paradigms.
  * How well does it integrate into with your workflow?
  Absolutely not at all. If I can't be bothered to use ChatGPT, or any number of Microsoft's Copilot suite (including GitHub), there's no way I'm using GitLab Duo.   Any other observations, missing features, workflow improvements, etc.   The old UI is perfectly serviceable and works just fine, its not broken. Why 'fix'/change it? The new UI provides an accessibility challenge for me as a dyslexic autist with exotropic strabismus. My instinct is to gravitate all my control to the left side and its where I initiate the bulk of my interaction.   Edited 3 weeks ago by Sophia McKeever
  *  
  * Emily Bauman@emilybauman3 weeks ago     Developer     @S.McKeever - Thanks for sharing all this feedback on the new UI. The accessibility concerns you've raised about visual pathing and navigation changes are really important, disrupting established patterns can make the interface much harder to use, especially when you rely on consistent visual cues.     Your points about colour saturation and everything moving away from the top-left area are good accessibility considerations we need to keep in mind. This feedback will be important as we continue iterating on an experience that works for everyone.

n7800@n78003 weeks ago   Contributor   Performance   As soon as the new interface's welcome screen opened, my computer's cooler started working hard. I felt a lag and was afraid my PC wouldn't be able to handle the new interface. Fortunately, after closing the welcome message, the cooler calmed down. I'm sure this window shouldn't consume so many resources, as it would immediately lower users' expectations of the new UI.   However, the interface itself has indeed become slower. For example, when hovering over elements (label, username, issue link), it takes about 5 seconds before a pop-up window appears. When switching to the old UI, I see a delay of no more than 2 seconds.   Opening issues is also slower. And when clicking in the comment field, it also hangs for a few seconds before typing becomes possible. When switching to the old UI, I can clearly see the difference.   Along with the IDE, I have a ton of GitLab tabs open, and my PC is already at its limits. Increased resource consumption will become a barrier to using GitLab and my work. Please be mindful of users with slower/heavier PCs. I also want to be able to conveniently open GitLab on a tablet/mobile, at least for browsing.   I hope you'll fix the performance issue before making the new IU the default for everyone. Please don't put this off until the next iteration.

  * n7800@n78002 weeks ago     Contributor     @seggenberger, I see that the performance of pop-ups (when hovering over labels, usernames, and comment mentions) has improved, thank you!     However, the speed at which the user list appears in the comment field for mentions is extremely slow. Typing characters after the @ practically freezes.     But I must say, I notice this only in big issues like this, and the old UI is also slow (it doesn't look like a regression).     Perhaps this can be improved as well?

n7800@n78003 weeks ago   Contributor   Feedback   When I wanted to report a regression, I had to search the browsing history for the issue. The thing is, I expected to see it in the left "Help" button, and only later noticed it in the drop-down menu when clicking on the user's avatar. I don't think this is entirely expected, although it does make some sense...   Basically, there's some overlap between these menus, and it's difficult to figure out which one is needed:   Left menuRight menu

  * Austin Regnery@aregnery3 weeks ago     Developer     I think this might be what you are noticing @eggerd. @thutterer when I'm hovering through the nav in the rail only, I can move fast enough that it sometimes doesn't catch that I have moved cursor focus to a item. Any ideas?     Hover_flyouts     cc: @seggenberger @jmiocene
  * John Hope@johnhope3 weeks ago     Developer     @aregnery I think this might be related to overall performance issues we're looking into on pages with a lot of DOM elements (such as this issue). We're seeing it on large commit pages also.
  * Thomas Hutterer@thutterer3 weeks ago     Maintainer     @aregnery @johnhope Another, secondary factor is the "wiggle room" that we added around the area between mouse cursor position and flyout menus to allow diagonal mouse movement from the menu section icon/title into a long flyout menu. Usually these are invisible, but they "look" like this:           So if you'd move your mouse down real fast (on the right side of the icon-only sidebar at least), or if your CPU is so busy that the SVG calculations aren't updated in time (as might be the case when other performance issues slow down the page), there is a certain area on which the hover stays on the current menu section (wiggle room svg), on purpose.     TLDR: I think there's nothing we have to do about this, because it only became noticable with other things slowing down the page.

However, you're right that this seems to be linked to large pages like this issue.

Atthar Mirza@am1310073 weeks ago   I've got some general design feedback, I feel there's a lot of wasted empty space in the new layout. I prefer the older one, because my eyes don't have to wander around the window to find what I need, it's elegantly laid out with navigation on the left and "content" on the right. And I like the information density with the older layout, no large sections of just an empty blue-ish gradient.
Kevin Ashton@ashtonkd3 weeks ago   Your role: Product Owner & Engineer   Main workflows: Epics/Issues/Boards, Merge Requests, Pipelines   Overall Assessment

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes - Seems like it has more potential for re-use vs. the "hovering" drawer.
    * No
    * Unsure
  What's Working Well
  * search interface is more obvious
  * content and drawer each feel "complete" vs. the drawer "obscuring" the primary content
  * much better use of space on ultrawide displays when using the new panels layout
  What Needs Fixing
  * Weird things are happening with browser history navigation (back/forward) - Using Firefox 145.0 (aarch64) (haven't tested other browsers)
    * HIGH - From "Issues" list page: Clicking on the fill icon or issue ID in the drawer opens that issue as expected, however, going Back in history returns to only the list page (with no drawer). A second Back navigation then oddly returns to the list page with the selected issue in the drawer. This is the opposite of the expected back navigation order. Maintaining context when navigating back to a list or board + details panel is critical. (Some of the navigation problems might have been preexisting with the original drawer overlay, but it feels even more jarring now and preexisting or not, it breaks workflow context.)
    * MEDIUM - Going Back to a page with ?show (drawer panel) seems to do a re-load which destroys the forward navigation browser history.
  * With the new drawer display feeling more integrated, some of the original interface annoyances are more prominent:
    * MEDIUM - It feels like I should be able to click+drag in the white space between the primary content panel and the detail/drawer panel to "resize" both panels by moving that divide. Not being able to is frustrating.
    * MEDIUM - It is now unexpected when links in drawer content (such as tasks on an issue) open a new page. It now feels like that content should load into the drawer/details panel instead (where the link was clicked) or potentially even better: slide the existing panels to the left and open a new sub-details panel (visually, this would make the "detail" panel the new "primary" panel.) -- somewhat like MacOS Finder in "Columns" view.
  * LOW - Other areas now feel like they should be using the panels interface and if feels a bit dis-joined that they're not. For example, the following areas would benefit from optionally displaying sub-element links in a details panel on the same page:
    * viewing job logs from a pipeline page
    * viewing registry details from the registries page
    * viewing a file from the repository page
  GitLab Duo panel (Duo Agent Platform)
  * Do you use the GitLab Duo panel?
    * Frequently
    * Sometimes
    * Rarely
    * Never
  * If not using it, why?
  We'd like to, but "Bring Your Own Model" isn't available for "Duo Core", so we don't currently use Duo at all.
  * How well does it integrate into with your workflow?
  It doesn't integrate. The GitLab Duo Panel seems like it would mostly just take up space and get in the way.   Any other observations, missing features, workflow improvements, etc.   How will the GitLab Duo panel display work for self-managed instances with Duo disabled at the instance, Group or Project level? It feels like strong user frustration point to have the Duo Panel displayed when the features are disabled for the current context.   Edited 3 weeks ago by Kevin Ashton

Why?     - [ ] Yes     - [X] No     - [ ] Unsure   **What Needs Fixing**   * MEDIUM - Egregious consumption of whitespace along with cartoon bubbles that consume even more whitespace is wasting my precious real estate. Gitlab is misapplying UX mantra from the web advertising industry, which seeks to take over the attention span of the viewer. This is exactly the opposite of what the UI/UX should do for a dev.

n7800@n78002 weeks ago   Contributor   Regression   In the old UI, when an issue was open sideways, I could click anywhere (the gap to the left of the list, the right of the "Open/Closed/All" tabs, or the empty space in the left sidebar) and it would close. Now I can only do this by clicking the "X" button. This is inconvenient - it's small and located on the opposite side of the screen from the issue list.   I expect the "issue" (sidebar) to close when clicking anywhere outside of it.   * I'm talking about the case when the issue is displayed over the list - for this to happen, the left sidebar must be expanded.
Alyssa Trinh@alyssatrinh2 weeks ago   Developer   design system feedback drawers now seem to be an inconsistent heights and widths. Some of them appear to take the entire content height. Some appear underneath breadcrumbs. Some have a shadowbox.   What's newIssue previewMerge request review buttonSettings > Repository > Branch rule   unsolicited thoughts a common UI convention in the industry is for drawers to take up the entire content area height. While this is disruptive, the nature of a drawer is already slightly disruptive and meant to surface information above the current UI. Placing a drawer underneath bread crumbs creates visual imbalance in the page, and suggests that breadcrumbs have a higher importance / visual hierarchy than the drawer content the UI is trying to surface.

laurent legaz@laurent.legaz2 weeks ago   Hello won't go down the path of "why are you doing the same redesign of your web client UI as it seems to be trending with your main concurrent owned by microsoft doing the same at around the same period of time", you do as well as you are pleased to.. and btw your design seem overall better tuned and less resources greedy than the reactJS one of GitHub. (By the "same" I mean same job : working on a already perfectly functional UI and well proven by time, on a large amount of different systems. But yeah I know, modernity.. at least you are trying to do it the right way, opposite to others I won't target too directly lmao)   That not being said I'm here to ask if it is normal that the scollbar on the right side is now bugged with the "new" design while trying to dropdown in a messy big amount of code in a PR review (merge request ? srsly ? wasn't it Pull Request before ? I have no motivation to start my CE GitLab and to check it myself)   Well I do not want to scroll using my wheel so I usually grab the scroll bar and not it is not working as it does before. The mouse cursor and the bar cursor are messed up and the thing jump and do not scroll smoothly as intended.   Regards,  laurent LEGAZ   Edited 2 weeks ago by laurent legaz

  * Austin Regnery@aregnery4 days ago     Developer     That not being said I'm here to ask if it is normal that the scollbar on the right side is now bugged with the "new" design while trying to dropdown in a messy big amount of code     Can you provide a screenshot or recording? The scrollbars should not be bugged.     merge request ? srsly ? wasn't it Pull Request before ?     @laurent.legaz it's always been merge request in GitLab 😄
  * laurent legaz@laurent.legaz3 days ago     @aregnery I'm more used to CE version than online and maybe I renamed labels or things.. or just my memory is failing me again 😅     So I have that big "merge request" open for years now and in my memory (so maybe not so good) I could drag and drop the scroll lift from top to bottom scrolling all 36 modified files smoothly.     But now the mouse cursor jumps to the bottom of my screen (few inches/centimeters away of the scroll bar I was dragging to the point I sometime have to redrag the scroll cursor else I would stay stuck on the bottom of the screen with my mouse cursor.     Maybe I'm not very clear and my memory isn't as accurate as I thought it could be once and I'm sorry for that.     Also the screenshot won't help because I can't capture my mouse cursor on windows, maybe I can screencast If you want ?
  * Austin Regnery@aregnery3 days ago     Developer     @laurent.legaz no worries, CE is applicable too. Yeah a screencast would be great.
  * laurent legaz@laurent.legaz2 days ago     But I think it is my old config (old i7) and my impatience that is in cause, because it happens also here, on this thread, if I don't wait for every elements on the page to load the cursor and the scrollbar jump to only god knows where here too.     So I think as the diffs are loading I just want the scroll cursor to scroll everything too fast in my opened merge request (but still this MR was opened before and I don't have the memory of that annoying blocking and scrollbar cursor jumps but... still maybe my memory failing).     I add that I use Opera now (not GX), and didn't try on other browser (not that I'm not willing to, just do not want to be logged out here for convenience reason), BUT previously I was on Chrome (so I wanted to test on chrome but I have to take more time to test it and again it is not convenient => 3rd party sign in....).     screencast_opera     Edited 2 days ago by laurent legaz

Ryan Taylor@crtaylor2 weeks ago   Developer   The 18.6 docs indicate that the new UI is only available in .com and Self-Managed, but the history shows that it was enabled for .com, Self-Managed, and Dedicated       Edited 2 weeks ago by Ryan Taylor

  *  
  * Niklas van Schrick@Taucher20032 weeks ago     Developer     As far as I know, Dedicated is on a N-1 release which means that Dedicated instances are currently on 18.5 where the new UI is disabled. Therefore the docs are correct that the new UI will be enabled on Dedicated once these instances update to 18.6 when 18.7 is released.
  * Ryan Taylor@crtaylor2 weeks ago     Developer     @Taucher2003 While I agree that GitLab 18.6 will be rolled out to Dedicated customers once 18.7 is released, I also think our documentation is intended to show what features are available for a specific version of GitLab     Thus, our 18.6 docs should be accurate for a Dedicated instance running 18.6, even if it is deployed to customers when 18.7 is available. This is the pattern elsewhere in our documentation site
  * Niklas van Schrick@Taucher20032 weeks ago     Developer     Ohh, I see. I didn't catch that the "Offering" didn't include Dedicated. That does seem like a mistake

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes
    * No
    * Unsure
  Why: Too much screen space is wasted. See What Needs Fixing for more details.   What's Working Well
  * I could see why opening issues in side panels would be helpful on wide displays. On my measly 1080p monitor it gets in the way more than helps though.
  * Being able to display more project related options in the left sidebar is a good idea.
  What Needs Fixing
  * MEDIUM Too much screen space is wasted. This change further reduces the amount of useful screen real-estate because of the search bar and the AI panel.
    * Moving the search bar only makes things worse as all the space to the left and right of it is wasted. There is also no need for it to be any wider than the sidebar where it used to live since it pops up a new dialog anyways. My suggestion would be that it goes back to live on the sidebar but lives next to the site log at the very top. It also doesn't need to be a text box (since it is a new dialog) and could just be a 🔍 icon.
    * I don't mind having the create/issues/mrs/workitems buttons and profile icon live on the right side of the screen but they shouldn't be on a mandatory top-row with the search bar. They could easily go down one row and live on the right side of the repo breadcrumbs bar.
  * MEDIUM The "Open in Side Panel" feature should be togglable in settings so those of us without ultra-wide monitors can disable it.
  * MEDIUM The GitLab Duo right bar should be hidable in settings so those who don't want to use it can hide it completely. Otherwise it is permanent wasted screen space.
    * It also doesn't need to have all three buttons visible at all times. Having a single button beside the User icon to open the chat pane would still work as the "New Chat" and "Chat History" buttons could be moved onto the chat pane that is created. That way only the bare minimum screen real-estate is given to the AI chat unless the user wants it.
  * LOW I miss the clear separation between sections in the left sidebar. Having a line above the "What's New" button would help differentiate it from the project specific things in the side bar.
  * LOW Having the "Collapse sidebar" option as a full row in the sidebar rather than a little button is unfortunate. I would much rather it go back to being an icon-only button and go back to where it was in the old UI beside the site icon.

  * It would be helpful to add an Appearance section into the "User Settings" page for the toggles of all these options
  * The "What's new", "Help", and Admin buttons don't need to always be visible and could be moved to the menu when clicking on the user icon. This would further increase the amount of space in the left sidebar for project-specific actions.
  * The header in the left sidebar containing "Project" (and "Group", "User Settings", "Admin", etc) could be moved up beside the site icon or removed entirely to further increase the space for project-specific options.

  What's Working Well
  * Brief bullet points
  What Needs Fixing
  * actions and information are scattered around the whole screen; you have to move the mouse / eyes the whole distance from left to right
  * too much space wasted with the search field on the top; its position and this of the buttons (which are now on the right) were fine in the old layout
  * space wasted with the border around the main area; for what is this? just to look cool?

  * it should be possible to set the default mode when creating a new issue (modal dialog vs. fullscreen); modal is too small for me and I prefer fullscreen
  * UI should respect user preferences of font size; when I set a default font size of 12px in the browser setup, I expect that the main content (e.g. the text which I am currently writing or the issue description or the other comments) is in a 12px font, not a 10.5 px one.

Many features are hidden behind unclear menus, and it’s often difficult to find what you actually need without searching the internet first. The interface feels overloaded and not beginner-friendly at all — even simple actions take more time than they should.   However, the new features are really impressive. The recent updates show that the team is moving in the right direction: the improvements to CI/CD, the new automation capabilities, and the enhanced security tools are excellent. If GitLab manages to make the UI simpler and provide proper instructions for every feature, it could easily become the best DevOps platform on the market.

n7800@n78001 week ago   Contributor   In incidents (not issues), you can still collapse the sidebar to a narrow view. I'd also like to see it returned for issues!   Especially useful for issues that open in the sidebar list!   Regression   However, in the new UI, it appears far from the edge.

Andrew Seales@andrew.seales1 week ago   Hi,   We just got the new UI this morning (18.6.1) and it's so much better than the last UI, in particular the performance is great. The old UI was quite laggy at times but this new one is super fast.   Thanks!
sigmatics@sigma671 week ago   I really like the new UI and its design direction, but as others have said, there is too much dead space, especially in the top bar.   To the left and right of the search bar there is now empty space. Previously, this was used for the navigation path, which was fine, but now the bar just sits there staring in my face, when it was doing just fine previously on top of the side bar.
Maximilian Riemensberger@mriemensberger6 days ago   Your role:   Main workflows:   Overall Assessment

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * Yes
    * No
    * Unsure
  What's Working Well
  * It largely works.
  What Needs Fixing
  * HIGH: The right side item view is not resizable. I use a relatively small but high-resolution screen (laptop). I have to do manual CSS overrides to make it work. I need the option to resize that thing on the fly and keep the setting for each device individually.
  * MEDIUM: The behavior is very inconsistent with regard to when items are opened in the right side item view and when they are opened as a new page. It seems to depend on the current view (list/board/other item), the type of link (child item list, related item list, regular link in comment, description, custom view), and the type of the item (work item vs MR). This is annoying since I now have to keep all those behaviors in my head to anticipate what happens if I click somewhere. I would really appreciate it if the behavior were consistent across all kinds of items (including MR), views, and types of links. I would not mind if it were configurable.
  * MEDIUM: I cannot choose whether I get the side-by-side items or the right side overlays the list/left side item. I would like to configure this on a per-device basis.
  * MEDIUM: I rarely use the search bar on the top since GitLab search is usually too slow and not that helpful. I would like to have this part of the screen be useful, i.e., the item should render to the top and the search bar and the few icons on the top right could easily be part of the left nav pane.

Niklas van Schrick@Taucher20035 days ago   Developer   I noticed that the new UI has some cases where it does not work on mobile:   parallel Jobs in the Pipeline detail page: The dropdown to select the job is going out of the viewport  On the advanced search page, I can't switch to a different search category   problemold uinew uiparallel Jobs in PipelinesAdvanced Search Page

  *  
  * Austin Regnery@aregnery4 days ago     Developer     @Taucher2003 use the Filters button to find those options on advanced search.
  * Niklas van Schrick@Taucher20033 days ago     Developer     @aregnery Aha! Thats absolutely not where I expected them. The Advanced Search problem is solved with that, but the problem with the parallel job dropdowns on the pipeline detail page remains. Those dropdowns are not usable on mobile when they clip out of the viewport. I always have to disable the new UI for that and when the toggle gets removed, this is going to be a problem because then there is no workaround
  * Austin Regnery@aregnery3 days ago     Developer     @Taucher2003 gotcha! I see the problem too, but I am seeing in both the versions of the UI. It might jus be your device is at a breakpoint that happens to work in the old UI but not the new. Either way it needs to be fixed.     CleanShot_2025-12-03_at_11.44.08     cc: @veethika

  * Would you prefer the new UI over current GitLab? Why?
    * No, definitely no. It looks odd, in theory, very little changes, but in practice, the top bar change is driving me nuts; it catches 99% of my attention.
  What's Working Well
  * Brief bullet points
  * I'm generally happy with the UI, excluding the newest one. I liked the most the one before the previous rework 1 or 2 years ago but eventually, I got used to what we had before this new ui.
  What Needs Fixing
  * Include priority: HIGH (blocks work) / MEDIUM (annoying) / LOW (polish)
  * non-ui stuff: CI pipelines need polishing, e.g. spec.inputs variable access via json
  * MEDIUM it's extremely annoying that changing the target branch when creating a merge request via .../merge_requests/new?merge_request[source_branch]=xyz, changing the target branch requires page refresh. It used to be a select 10 years ago and this (very common, in my case) operation was way easier and less annoying.
  * MEDIUM this template needs fixing too; it is incredibly inconsistent and hard to use.
  * HIGH GitLab designers should start honoring their users muscle memory and habits
  * LOW suggestions in merge request comments are generally a great feature. The could be polished though, e.g. multiline suggestions could be easier to prepare and the whole feature could be easier to discover.

    * No. Definite no.
    * Unsure
  What's Working Well
  * Nothing I particularly like honestly.
  What Needs Fixing
  * HIGH The scroll bar is no longer at the edge of the window. This means I need to aim carefully to hit it with the mouse. This is beyond annoying, it actively slows me down.
  * MEDIUM In some pages (such as this issue), the scroll bar can disappear behind other elements (such as when scrolling to the top of this issue).
  * HIGH Typing in issue comments is laggy, even when using the markdown editor. There's a delay between typing and a character appearing. Typing at normal speed causes a bunch of characters to appear all at once every few seconds.

  * How well does it integrate into with your workflow?
  It doesn't. Only use case I've ever had for these agents is as advanced search in code bases I don't know much about. That doesn't appear to be what you're aiming it towards, so I don't care.   Any other observations, missing features, workflow improvements, etc.
  * The scroll bar not being at the edge of the window is a huge deal breaker for me.
  * Panel/window-based web apps are among some of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of using. Don't emulate the style for gitlab, please.
  * We don't need more AI slop. AI is a decent tool for search. But we don't need more ways to generate bad code.

  In the new MR page and the compare revisions page, the diff highlighting is only in the gutter.

Florent Rougon@frougon1 day ago   Hello,   As many already said, reviewing diffs with the new UI is horrible. Vertical space is taken by mostly useless elements; what remains for the diff is far from sufficient.   I had tried the new UI and switched back to the previous one because of this. Today, I see the new one is being forced upon me. :-((   Edited 1 day ago by Florent Rougon
Jessie Arellano@jessie.arellano1 day ago   Please reinstate the toggle for the old UI. The new interface has made pages such as viewing pipelines incredibly painful to navigate. I know it has been mentioned several times, but it has made looking at diffs a lot more difficult especially on a wide-screen monitor.

Austin Regnery@aregnery1 day ago   Developer   Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us. I have personally read every message in this issue, and I genuinely appreciate the time you've taken to provide detailed feedback about the navigation changes.   I want to acknowledge that this transition has been challenging for some of you, and your concerns are valid. While the data showed a low opt-out rate (<1%), I recognize that metrics don't capture the full picture of how changes impact individual workflows and preferences. For those who preferred the previous UI, I understand if this wasn't the outcome you hoped for.   The new UI is now the standard experience moving forward. This decision wasn't made lightly, and maintaining two parallel UI structures long-term would significantly impact our ability to iterate and improve GitLab for everyone. That said, we're committed to addressing the remaining bugs and continuing to refine the experience based on your feedback.   Many of the ideas shared here are valuable, and we're actively reviewing them for future iterations. Your input directly shapes how we prioritize improvements, so please continue sharing specific pain points or suggestions.   Thank you for your patience and for being part of this community
